# Africa
A Full Fledged Animal Detail iOS Application By Using SwiftUI

Hi All, I have created a beautiful iOS Application Named "Africa" By Using SwiftUI

Here's The Glimpse of Concepts I Have used ->

•	JSON Data with Swift (basic and advanced approach).

•	Grid Layouts (basic and advanced approach with a cool feature).

•	MapKit Integration ( with another cool feature).

•	Video Player (new SwiftUI feature).

•	Launch Screen (new way).

•	Swift programming concept: Extension, Generics.

•	Prototype the whole application with SwiftUI framework.

Watch This beautiful video and see its User Friendly layout system, with Tab menu showing the additional features, It’s an fully-featured iOS App 
which works on all iOS devices, right from iPhone to iPadOS to macOS with Mac Catalyst framework with an ease, Experience this beautiful application
